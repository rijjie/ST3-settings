# Gitconfig Syntax Definition

A Sublime Text 2 syntax definition file to offer syntax coloring for your `.gitconfig` files.  *It may work with TextMate also, but I haven't tested it.*

# Installation

## Manual Installation

Go to the "Packages" directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages...`).  Then clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/lifted-studios/Gitconfig.tmLanguage

# Usage

Once installed, you can open any file and select the Gitconfig syntax from the syntax picker in the status bar or it should be selected automatically when you open a file named `.gitconfig`.
